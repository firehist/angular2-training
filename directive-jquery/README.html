<h3>Form Builder</h3>

<h4>Component</h4>

<ol><li>Import <code>FormBuilder</code> and <code>Validators</code> from <code>angular2/common</code></li><li>Inject an instance of <code>FormBuilder</code> into the constructor</li><li>A form is just a control group, so we create the form by calling <code>builderInstance.group</code></li><li>We pass in an object with one or more controls or control groups...we can nest it however we like</li><li>A control has the name of the control as the key, and the value is an array in the form of <code>[initialValue, validator(s)]</code></li><li>If we want to use multiple validators, we call <code>Validators.compose</code>, passing in an array with all the validators we need</li></ol>

<h4>Template</h4>

<ol><li>Add an <code>ngFormModel</code> directive to the form element and bind it to the form we created in the component</li><li>Everything else stays the same except we do not need to put our validators directly on the input elements...we have them defined in the component already</li></ol>
